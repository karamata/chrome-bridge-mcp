# Feature Specification: Chrome Extension + MCP Server Integration

**Feature Branch**: `[001-c-t-ph]`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Chrome Extension for web activity tracking with MCP Server integration"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: How should the system handle sensitive data (passwords, auth tokens, PII) captured in network logs and user inputs? ‚Üí A: Exclude sensitive requests from capture entirely
- Q: What is the data retention policy for stored session data? ‚Üí A: Local data kept until session ended, server data retained indefinitely
- Q: Who can access and manage the captured session data? ‚Üí A: Public access - anyone with MCP server connection can view all data
- Q: What are the performance limits for data capture and storage? ‚Üí A: No hard limits - constrained only by browser/storage capacity
- Q: What authorization is required for MCP clients to send commands to control the extension? ‚Üí A: No authorization - any connected MCP client can send commands

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to track web activity on specific domains through a Chrome extension that can work independently or sync with an MCP server. The extension captures events, console logs, network traffic, and screenshots, while allowing MCP clients to query and control the extension remotely.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user installs the Chrome extension, **When** they click "Start Session" on a domain, **Then** a new session is created for that domain and data capture begins
2. **Given** an active session is running, **When** the user clicks "Stop Session", **Then** data capture stops and the session is marked as completed
3. **Given** captured data exists, **When** the user clicks "Export JSON", **Then** all session data is downloaded as a JSON file
4. **Given** the extension is connected to MCP server, **When** data is captured, **Then** the data is automatically synced to the server
5. **Given** an MCP client is connected, **When** they query extension sessions, **Then** they receive a list of available sessions with metadata
6. **Given** an MCP client sends a command, **When** the extension is online, **Then** the command is executed and results returned

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the extension loses connection to MCP server during data sync?
- How does the system handle when storage limits are exceeded? [RESOLVED: No hard limits - constrained by browser/storage capacity]
- What happens when multiple users try to access the same session data simultaneously?
- How does the system handle sensitive data in network logs (passwords, tokens)? [RESOLVED: Exclude sensitive requests from capture entirely]
- What happens when the browser crashes during an active session?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to start and stop capture sessions for specific domains
- **FR-002**: System MUST capture click events, input events, and navigation changes during active sessions
- **FR-003**: System MUST capture console logs (log, error, warn, info) during active sessions
- **FR-004**: System MUST capture network traffic including XHR, fetch, and WebSocket communications, excluding sensitive requests containing passwords, auth tokens, or PII
- **FR-005**: System MUST capture screenshots as base64 strings during sessions
- **FR-006**: System MUST store captured data locally within the browser for the current session
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to export session data as JSON files
- **FR-008**: System MUST sync captured data to MCP server when connection is available
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide manual sync functionality for unsynced data
- **FR-010**: System MUST clear previous local session data when starting a new session on the same domain, while preserving server data indefinitely
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow any MCP client with server connection to list available extension sessions
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow any MCP client with server connection to retrieve complete session data by session ID
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow any MCP client with server connection to filter events, logs, and network traffic by various criteria
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow any MCP client with server connection to send commands to control the extension without authorization requirements
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide a web interface to view and manage extension session data
- **FR-016**: System MUST create separate management sessions for MCP clients independent of extension sessions
- **FR-017**: System MUST handle connection failures gracefully without interrupting extension functionality
- **FR-018**: System MUST maintain session metadata including session ID, domain, creation time, and last update time

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Extension Session**: Represents a single tracking session for a specific domain, containing captured events, logs, network data, and screenshots
- **MCP Client Session**: Represents a connection session from an MCP client (Claude, GPT, Cursor, etc.) for querying and controlling extensions
- **Captured Event**: User interactions including clicks, inputs, and navigation with timestamps and target information
- **Console Log Entry**: System-generated messages with type (log, error, warn, info), timestamp, and message content
- **Network Request**: HTTP/HTTPS communications including request/response details, headers, and timing
- **Screenshot**: Visual capture of the current page state as base64 encoded data with timestamp
